# Ramona Js 
Ramona Js - simple js library for creating useful components which have own **entry element, props, states, views, and logic.**
This is the first attempt to create my own javascript library.
It's little bit dumb for now.
But soon maybe it will become a powerful tool in the hands of the frontend developers.
Or only in my hands... :)
Now better use the others normal libs like Vue or React :)
